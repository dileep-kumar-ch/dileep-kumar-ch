# 👋 Hey, I’m Dileep Kumar!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub 👨‍💻  
I’m a *Backend Developer | Full Stack Developer | Builder in Progress* —  
writing code that scales, solves real-world problems, and sometimes even makes me feel smarter than my debugger. 😎

## 🚀 About Me

💻 *Tech I Use*: Backend with Java & Spring Boot, frontend  with React.js & JS  
📚 *Currently Exploring*:  Microservices, Spring Security, Docker and minimalism in code ✨  
🛠  *I like building real-world projects to strengthen backend fundamentals 
😂 *Fun Fact*: I spent 2 hours naming a variable... it’s still called temp 🤷‍♂
